	 *
	 * @param message_json: The push's data contents will be stored here.
	 * @param uuid: The uuid for which games will be checked.
	 * @param games_I_am_aware_of: A map of game_uid to game_state that the client being babysat is already aware of.
	 *
	 * @sideeffect: games_I_am_aware of will be updated to contain all things that have already been pushed to the
	 *              client.
	 * @sideeffect: active_game_uids_I_am_aware_of will be updated to reflect active games that have already been
	 *              pushed to the client.
	 * @sideeffect: message_json will be modified to contain the relevant data.
	 *              The json contains the following keys:
	 *                  HANDLER_KEY: <this function>
	 *                  CODE_KEY: 200 (if something changed), 204 (if nothing changed)
	 *                  MESSAGE_KEY: "You have [new|changed|new and changed|] games!" (depending on situation), or
	 *                               "Nothing changed." (if nothing changed).
	 *                  "game_uids": A list of the new/changed game_uids
	 *                  "game_states": A list of the states of the new/changed game_uids. New games have no state
	 *                                 and are an empty string.
	 *              Note that it follows that reported game_uids that do not represent concluded games are waiting
	 *                  for the player to make a move.
     *
     * @returns Nothing
