  /* @brief Returns a list of messages for any new/changed games associated with the given uuid.
   *
   * @param log_id: A string prepended to diagnostics
   * @param uuid: The uuid for which games will be checked.
   *
   * @sideeffect: games_I_am_aware of will be updated to contain all things that have already been pushed to the
   *              client.
   * @sideeffect: active_game_uids_I_am_aware_of will be updated to reflect active games that have already been
   *              pushed to the client.
	 *
   * @returns: If there are new/changed games, the result will contain a message with the following keys:
   *             HANDLER_KEY: "push_active_games"
   *             CODE_KEY: 200
   *             MESSAGE_KEY: "You have [new|changed|new and changed|] games!" (depending on situation)
   *             "game_uids": A list of the new/changed game_uids
   *             "game_states": A list of the states of the new/changed game_uids. New games have no state
   *                            and are an empty string.
   *           Note that it follows that reported game_uids that do not represent concluded games are waiting
   *               for the player to make a move.
